# CodeAlpha_TaskAutomation
This project is a **Task Automation Script** designed to handle common file management and system maintenance tasks, including file organization, data cleaning, and clearing temporary files. It consists of three main automated tasks: organizing files in a directory, cleaning text files, and removing temporary files from the system. The project uses a simple and flexible architecture, with each task wrapped in a decorator that logs the start and completion time, allowing users to track the execution of each task.

The first task, **File Organization**, categorizes files in a specified directory based on their file types, such as text files, images, PDFs, spreadsheets, presentations, and scripts. Files that don't match any predefined category are moved into an "Others" folder. The second task, **Data Cleaning**, processes all `.txt` files in the directory, removing empty lines and unnecessary whitespace to ensure clean data. The final task, **System Maintenance**, clears temporary files from the systemâ€™s temp directory, helping to free up space and keep the system optimized.

This script is written in Python and uses core libraries such as `os`, `shutil`, and `tempfile` for file operations, and `functools` and `time` to log task execution. It is fully automated, and users can run all tasks by simply providing the directory path. The project can be expanded to include additional maintenance tasks or customized file handling operations.
